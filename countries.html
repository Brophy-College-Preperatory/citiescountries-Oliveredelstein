  <p>This is the first computer ever. It could calculate equations and store up to one kilobyte of memory (a 16 by 16 pixel icon or a page of text). Charles Babbage began its design in the 1830s, but never completed it. We collaborated on many parts of the design and I developed programs for it like the one above.</p>
